            <p>Jon, here.</p>
            <p>
               Dad put me in charge of a lot of things in his life. That
               includes his finances, bills, time management, visitors, material
               effects, and more.
            </p>
            <p>
               With that said, since no one is local and everyone is spread out
               across multiple states, I built this website to allow everyone
               the ability to look around Dad's house to see what they want to
               keep. This can be pictures or any other material items, like his
               relciners or desk.
            </p>

                  This is not a first-come-first-serve system. Everyone has time
                  to look around.

               I'd like to make a rather important note:{" "}

               Please consider that prior to expressing any and all interests.
            </p>
            <p>
               As I said, this is not a first-come-first-served system. However,
               at any point, I may have to begin removing items from the house.
               This includes posting estate sales, selling to thrift stores,
               donating to whatever, or even throwing things away. This is due
               to the lack of time I/we have on getting the house ready for...
               whatever we decide after the unfortunate event of dad's passing.
               Due to the reverse mortgage, we have maybe 6 months when this is
               no longer dad's primary place of residence. I plan on calling the
               reverse mortgage place to confirm timelines.
